# Python Network Stress Tester

> ⚠️ For **educational use only**. Do not run this script against any system you do not explicitly own or have written permission to test.

---

## 📖 Description

This is a simple Python script that uses multi-threading and sockets to simulate repeated connections to a specified target IP and port. It's intended for **learning purposes only**, such as understanding how sockets and threading behave in Python, and how basic network stress tools work.

---

## 🛠 Features

- Multi-threaded socket flooding
- Basic fake IP header (for simulation)
- Logs connection count
- Lightweight — no dependencies beyond Python standard library

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Take-Off-7/Python-Authomation.git
cd Python-Authomation

### 2. Start a local HTTP server for testing:

In one terminal window, run:

bash
python -m http.server 80

This starts a local HTTP server at:
http://127.0.0.1:80

### 3. Run the script:

Open a new terminal window, navigate back into the project folder (if not already), and run:

bash
python main.py

You should see output like:
Connections made: 500
Connections made: 1000
Connections made: 1500
...
This means the script is successfully opening many connections to your test server.
